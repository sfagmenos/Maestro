\section{Conclusion}
\label{sect:conc}
In this white paper we present an introductory description of \lang{}, a language
intended to help users describe and orchestrate jobs based on a-priory know dependencies.
In future, during the evolution of our project, there may be additional functionality
implemented, but the core specifications of \lang{} will iremain as is.
