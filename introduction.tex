\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:intro}

Frequently a user allocates a pool of machines in order to conduct experimental
evaluation represented in the format of scripts. In a broad sense, an end-user
operates on a pool of machines and allocates jobs represented in a scripting
language. \lang{} is a programming language which provides user the ability
to express powerful semantics related to job distribution and scheduling.
The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate features and functionality 
supported by \lang{}. Also, we provide exemplary programs  to
explain how \lang{}  should be used to create jobs, describe dependencies amongst jobs,
and execute jobs on workers. Our examples include a simple Hello World program as well as
more complex programs which cover \lang{}'s functionality in details.
