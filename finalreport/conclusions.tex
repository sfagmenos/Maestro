\begin{itemize}
\item For a large project such as this one, it is important to have a gameplan ready ahead of time. It was especially apparent to us that we needed to be able to manage our time well, since each team member gets exponentially busier as the semester matures. 
\item We learned to make full use of version control using GitHub. This helped each of us stay on track with others' progress, and stay in sync through the course of the semester.
\item Communication was key in making this project successful. We learned that we had to be able to talk to our team members with an open mind, and at the same time also make our point come across in a respectful way.
\end{itemize}

Being a part of the team that built Maestro has been my first experience with working on a large-scale project. I learned a lot about how to work with a team and deliver code on time.
One of the biggest takeaways for me is my knowledge of the intrinsics of compilers. I had to dive into the nitty-gritty of what I, as a developer, had taken for granted for most of my coding lifetime. Being able to understand \textit{why} a compiler does what it does, \textit{how} it does it and understanding how all of its parts come together to make a robust piece of software is of the utmost importance.
