- Lists

The list type is a container that holds a number of other objects, in a given order. The list type implements a sequence, and also allows you to add and remove objects from the sequence.

Lists are created as:

L = [<expr>, <expr>, ...]

An item in a list can be accessed using the list index

Item = L [index]
