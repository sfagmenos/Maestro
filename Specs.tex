\subsection{Operators}
+, -, /, \%, *, >, <, >=, <=, <>, +=, -=, ==, and, or, not, ->, <->

\subsection{Lists and Dictionaries}

- Lists

The list type is a container that holds a number of other objects, in a given order.
The list type implements a sequence, and also allows you to add and remove objects from the sequence.

Lists are created as:

L = [<expr>, <expr>, ...]
L = [23, 45, 2]

An item in a list can be accessed using the list index. Indices start from 0.

Item = L [<index>]
Item = L [0]



- Dictionary

The dictionary type is an associative array that holds a pair of items called a key-value pair.
Keys in the dictionary have to be unique.

Dictionaries are created as:

Dict = {<expr> : <expr>, <expr>, <expr>, ...}
Dict = { 'Bob' : '1974', 'alice' : '1987', ...}

A value in a dictionary can be accessed using its corresponding key.

Val = Dict [<key>]
Val = Dict ['Bob']




\subsection{Datatypes}

- INT

Integer datatypes are declared using the 'Int' keyword. Integer variables can store whole number values like 0, 7, -1024
Variable names have to begin with an alphabet. Int support both signed and unsigned values.

Integer variables are declared as:

Int <var>, <var>, ...
Int <var> = <var_name>

Int a, b, c
Int a = 234


- FLOAT

Float integer types can store real values like 1.03, -23.56. Floating Point datatypes are declared using the 'Float' keyword. Variable names have to begin with an alphabet.

Integer variables are declared as:

Int <var>, <var>, ...
Int <var> = <var_name>

Int a, b, c
Int a = 234




\subsection{Dependences}
Dependencies between programs can be specified in the language using single $-->$ arrows. Bidirectional $<-->$ arrows indicate that programs should be run in parallel. This provides a clean easy syntax for straightforward job dependencies, in the spirit of Python's list comprehensions. For grouping, use parentheses.

Example 1:
Job B takes as input a file that Job A outputs. 'program_a --> program_b'

Example 2: 
Jobs $A$, $B$, and $C$ should be run in parallel. 'program_a <--> program_b <--> program_c'

Example 3:
Jobs $A$ and $B$ to be run in parallel, with Job $C$ dependent. ('program_a'<-->'program_b')--> 'program_c'
