\section{Conclusion}
\label{sect:conclusion}
The \lang{} Tutorial gives all the necessary documantation for both the experience programmer
but also for the beginner to understand the main ideas of the language. We want to achieve that
both groups will be able to write complex \lang{} programs after a few hours from the first look
of this tutorial. \lang{} introduce 3 ways to implement the dependencies. Maybe this sounds
confusing but it is the only way to give freedom to the user to use whatever method seems
better for him. Also the variety continues with the way you can introduce workers to the language.
This gives the user the ability to work from everywhere and with everything. Either work offline locally
but also launching the batch in a cluster. For a better insight of the \lang{} language you can 
see in the Language Reference Manual where we explain the architecture of the language.
