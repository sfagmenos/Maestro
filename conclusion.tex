\section{Conclusion}
\label{sect:conclusion}
The \lang{} Tutorial gives all the necessary documantation for both the experience programmer
but also for the beginner to understand the main ideas of the language. We want to achieve that
both groups will be able to write complex \lang{} programs after a few hours from the first 
look of this tutorial. For a better insight of the \lang{} language you can see in the Language
Reference Manual where we explain the architecture of the language.
