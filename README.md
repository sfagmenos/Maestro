- A language for scheduling jobs in a data center (distribute a list of jobs in a datacenter).

Comments
========
The idea of creating a language for creating school scheduls seems an interesting one.
It is clear what types we will use to create it, what restrictions should be supported,
and what kind of outputs users would expect. I am into this idea!
